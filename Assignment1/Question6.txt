Writing Java Code: Developers write Java programs using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Java source code files typically have a .java extension.

Compilation: The Java compiler (javac) reads the Java source code and performs various tasks. It checks the syntax and semantics of the code, verifies type compatibility, and generates bytecode. If the compiler encounters any errors during this process, it reports them as compilation errors and halts the compilation process.

Bytecode Generation: Assuming the compilation is successful, the Java compiler generates bytecode, which is a set of instructions in a format that can be understood by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Bytecode is stored in a file with a .class extension.

Execution: The generated bytecode can be executed on any platform that has a compatible JVM. The JVM interprets the bytecode and performs the necessary operations to execute the program. It handles tasks such as memory management, security checks, and dynamic linking.
