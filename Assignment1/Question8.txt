Naming Rules:

Identifiers must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z), underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
After the first character, identifiers can also include digits (0-9).
Java is case-sensitive, so uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different.
Identifiers should not be a reserved word (e.g., keywords like int, class, for, etc.).
Conventions and Best Practices:

It is recommended to use meaningful and descriptive names for identifiers to enhance code readability.
By convention, variables and methods should use camelCase, starting with a lowercase letter (e.g., myVariable, calculateTotal()).
Class and interface names should use PascalCase, starting with an uppercase letter (e.g., MyClass, MyInterface).
Constants (static final variables) are usually written in uppercase with underscores separating words (e.g., MAX_SIZE, PI_VALUE).
Examples of Identifiers:

Variable identifier: age, firstName, isFinished
Method identifier: calculateArea(), printMessage()
Class identifier: Car, Person, Employee
Interface identifier: Drawable, Comparable
Constant identifier: MAX_SIZE, PI_VALUE
