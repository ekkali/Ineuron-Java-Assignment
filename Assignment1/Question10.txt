Class Loader Subsystem:

Class Loader: Responsible for loading Java class files into the JVM. It locates, loads, and links the classes needed for execution.
Class Area: Stores the runtime representation of loaded classes, including field and method information.
Runtime Data Areas:

Heap: The runtime data area where objects are allocated. It is divided into several generations (Young, Old, Perm/Metaspace) and is responsible for memory management, including garbage collection.
Method Area: Stores class-level data, including method bytecode, constant pool, and static variables. It is shared among all threads and classes.
Java Stacks: Each thread has its own Java stack, consisting of stack frames. It holds method invocations, local variables, and partial results.
Execution Engine:

Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler: Compiles bytecode into native machine code at runtime for efficient execution. It optimizes frequently executed code segments.
Interpreter: Executes bytecode line-by-line, interpreting and executing instructions sequentially.
Native Method Interface (JNI):

Provides a way to call native code (written in other programming languages like C or C++) from Java programs. It allows interaction between Java and the underlying operating system.
Native Method Libraries:

Contains native libraries required for the execution of Java programs. These libraries provide the interface between Java and the underlying system resources, such as I/O operations or network access.
Execution Control:

Program Counter: Keeps track of the currently executing instruction within a method.
Thread Scheduler: Manages the execution of multiple threads, including thread creation, synchronization, and context switching.
