The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) manages memory using several different memory areas. Here are the main memory areas allocated by the JVM:

Heap Memory:

The heap memory area is where objects are allocated in Java.
It is a shared memory region used by all threads in an application.
The JVM automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation for objects in the heap through garbage collection.
The size of the heap can be adjusted using JVM command-line options.
Method Area (a.k.a. Permanent Generation or Metaspace):

The method area stores class structures, method code, field information, and constant pool.
In older JVM versions, it was known as the Permanent Generation (PermGen) and used to store interned strings, static variables, and class metadata.
In newer JVM versions (Java 8 and later), the PermGen space has been replaced by Metaspace, which stores class metadata and is dynamically sized by the JVM.
Java Stack (a.k.a. Stack Memory):

The Java stack is used for storing method frames.
Each thread in the JVM has its own stack, which is created when the thread is started.
Each method invocation creates a new frame on the stack, storing local variables, method arguments, and intermediate calculation results.
The stack memory is organized as a stack data structure, with push and pop operations for method call and return.
PC Registers:

PC (Program Counter) registers contain the address of the currently executing instruction.
Each thread in the JVM has its own set of PC registers.
The PC registers are used to keep track of the next instruction to be executed for each thread.
Native Method Stacks:

The native method stacks are used for executing native (non-Java) code.
They are similar to the Java stack but specifically used for native method invocations.
