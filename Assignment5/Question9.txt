Extending the Thread class: In this approach, you create a new class that extends the Thread class and override its run() method. The run() method contains the code that will be executed when the thread starts. You can then create an instance of your custom thread class and call its start() method to begin the execution.

Implementing the Runnable interface: In this approach, you create a class that implements the Runnable interface. The Runnable interface defines a single method run() that represents the task to be executed by the thread. You provide the implementation for the run() method in your class. Then, you can create an instance of your class and pass it as an argument to a Thread object. Finally, you call the start() method on the Thread object to start the execution.
