throw:

The throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception within a program.
It is followed by an exception object or an expression that evaluates to an exception object.
The throw statement is typically used when a program encounters an error or an exceptional condition that needs to be explicitly signaled.
It can be used in methods, constructors, or any block of code to indicate that an exceptional condition has occurred.
The throw statement causes the program flow to stop and the control to be transferred to the nearest matching catch block to handle the thrown exception.
throws:

The throws keyword is used in the method declaration to specify that a particular method may throw one or more types of exceptions.
It is followed by a comma-separated list of exception types.
When a method is declared with the throws keyword, it indicates that the method might throw exceptions that need to be handled by the caller or propagated further.
It allows the caller of the method to be aware of the potential exceptions that may be thrown and provides an opportunity to handle those exceptions appropriately.
If a method declares checked exceptions with throws, the caller must either catch those exceptions using try-catch blocks or declare them to be thrown as well.
