ambda expressions were introduced in Java 8 as a new feature to simplify the process of writing functional interfaces. A lambda expression is a concise way to represent a method as an expression. It provides a more compact and readable syntax for writing code that relies heavily on functional programming.

(parameters) -> expression or statement block


Calculator addition = (a, b) -> a + b;


// Single-parameter lambda expression
Runnable runnable = () -> System.out.println("Hello, Lambda!");

// No-parameter lambda expression
Supplier<Double> randomNumber = () -> Math.random();
