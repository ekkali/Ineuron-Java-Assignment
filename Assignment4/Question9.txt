Lambda expressions in Java 8 bring several benefits and enhancements to the language. Here are some of the key advantages of lambda expressions:

Concise Syntax: Lambda expressions provide a compact and concise syntax for representing behavior as data. They allow you to write more expressive code by reducing the boilerplate code associated with anonymous inner classes.

Readability: Lambda expressions improve code readability by focusing on the essence of the behavior being expressed, rather than distracting with unnecessary implementation details. They provide a clear and concise way to represent functional behavior.

Functional Programming Paradigm: Lambda expressions enable functional programming paradigms in Java. They allow you to treat behavior as data and facilitate the use of higher-order functions, which accept functions as arguments or return functions as results.

Improved API Design: Lambda expressions enhance API design by allowing the creation of functional interfaces that can be used with lambda expressions or method references. This leads to more flexible and expressive APIs that are easier to use and understand.

Code Reusability: Lambda expressions promote code reusability by providing a way to encapsulate behavior and pass it around as data. They allow you to define behavior once and reuse it in multiple contexts, leading to more modular and maintainable code.

Increased Productivity: With lambda expressions, you can write code more quickly and with fewer lines of code. They simplify common coding patterns and enable developers to express complex behavior more efficiently.

Enhanced Collections Framework: Lambda expressions work seamlessly with the Streams API introduced in Java 8. They enable functional-style operations on collections, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing, making it easier to work with data in a more declarative and expressive way.

Parallel Processing: The use of lambda expressions in conjunction with the Streams API allows for easier parallel processing of data. The Streams API can automatically leverage multi-core processors, resulting in improved performance and scalability.
