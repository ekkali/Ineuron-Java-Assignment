In this program, the checkLetter() method takes a word and a character as parameters and performs the following steps:

It iterates through each character in the word using a for loop.

Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is equal to the specified letter using the charAt() method.

If a match is found, it returns true to indicate that the letter is present in the word.

If no match is found after iterating through all the characters, it returns false to indicate that the letter is not present in the word.

The main() method calls the checkLetter() method with the word "Umbrella" and the letter 'e' and prints the result.
