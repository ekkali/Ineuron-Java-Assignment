Using the equals() method:

The equals() method compares the contents of two strings to check if they are equal.
It returns a boolean value: true if the strings are equal, and false otherwise.
Syntax: string1.equals(string2)

Using the compareTo() method:

The compareTo() method compares two strings lexicographically.
It returns an integer value that indicates the comparison result:
If the strings are equal, it returns 0.
If the first string is lexicographically greater than the second string, it returns a positive value.
If the first string is lexicographically less than the second string, it returns a negative value.
Syntax: string1.compareTo(string2)

It's important to note that when comparing strings in Java, the equals() method should be used for content equality checks, while the compareTo() method is suitable for lexicographical comparison.

Additionally, Java provides the equalsIgnoreCase() method, which performs a case-insensitive comparison of strings.
