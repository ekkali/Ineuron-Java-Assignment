JDK (Java Development Kit), JRE (Java Runtime Environment), and JVM (Java Virtual Machine) are key components of the Java platform. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

JDK (Java Development Kit):

JDK is a software development kit provided by Oracle (previously Sun Microsystems) that includes all the tools necessary for developing Java applications.
It contains the Java compiler (javac) for compiling Java source code into bytecode, various development tools (e.g., java, javap, jar), and libraries required for Java development.
JDK is typically used by Java developers to write, compile, debug, and package Java applications.
JRE (Java Runtime Environment):

JRE is an environment that enables the execution of Java applications. It includes the JVM and necessary libraries and files required to run Java programs.
JRE does not contain development tools or a compiler; it is designed for end-users who only need to run Java applications.
When you install a Java application on your computer, you typically need to install the JRE to execute it.
JVM (Java Virtual Machine):

JVM is an integral part of both the JDK and JRE. It is responsible for executing Java bytecode.
JVM acts as an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment for Java programs.
It translates the bytecode into machine-specific instructions for the underlying operating system and hardware, allowing Java programs to be platform-independent.
JVM also provides various services such as memory management, garbage collection, and security.
